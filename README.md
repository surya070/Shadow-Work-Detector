# Shadow Work â€” Revealing the Hidden Effort in Teams

Prototype that analyzes team communications and surfaces "shadow work" contributions
(reminders, emotional support, coordination).

## Quick start (local)

1. Create a Python venv:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Start the backend (Flask):

cd shadow-work/backend
python app.py


4. Backend will run by default at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

5. In another terminal, start the dashboard:

cd shadow-work/dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py



Streamlit UI usually opens at http://localhost:8501.
